                <p>Located at 110 Broad Street, Boulevard on the Greenway was developed by New Boston Ventures, a South End-based firm that has completed more than 50 projects around eastern Massachusetts since its founding in 1986. Standing 12 stories tall and offering 36 luxury condo units – 31 that are at market rate and five that serve as live-and-work lofts for artists – the building boasts a gorgeous glass lobby that incorporates the original façade of the warehouse that once stood at the site. Designed by renowned architect Charles Bulfinch, the warehouse served as a repository for goods that had come into the nearby wharves for many decades.</p>

                <p>Directly above the building’s stunning lobby on the second floor are most of the prime amenities that residents of the building can enjoy. These include a state-of-the-art private fitness center; a club room with an on-site catering kitchen; and a pet spa. Indeed, the building welcomes pets with open arms, which is only fitting in a city whose residents adore catering to their furry, four-legged friends. Residents also enjoy the use of a high-tech automated guided vehicle system, or AGV system. Also billed as an automated car valet system, it features a platform on which a car is initially parked before being delivered via a computer-guided treadmill-style system to its designated slot. The system has a capacity of 48 vehicles.</p>

                <p>The building and its amenities are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to why more than 75 percent of its units had been sold as of August 2018. The residences themselves are, of course, among the most luxurious in the city. The one-, two- and three-bedroom luxury condos feature elegant, open floor plans and offer an average of around 1,774 square feet of space. There are also four exquisitely appointed penthouses on the 11th and 12th floors that were also snapped up very quickly.</p>

                <p>All of the luxury residences in this building feature upscale fits and finishes. Kitchens boast Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances, entertainment-sized islands and plenty of other perks. These units also offer floor-to-ceiling glass walls and windows, making the most of the spectacular views of Boston Harbor, the Rose Kennedy Greenway and surrounding areas.
