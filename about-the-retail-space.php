                <p>Its easy to see why setting up shop on the ground floor of the new Boulevard on the Greenway would be a wise move for any retailer. The building offers more than 3,500 square feet of such space, and it is unlikely to remain available for long. With its prime location and exciting local demographics, the building is sure to drive tons of business to its ground-floor establishments â€“ and yours could be one of them.
