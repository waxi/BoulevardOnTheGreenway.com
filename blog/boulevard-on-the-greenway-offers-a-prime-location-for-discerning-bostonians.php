                <p>With its location directly on the Rose Kennedy Greenway at 110 Broad Street, Boulevard on the Greenway, a recently developed luxury condo building with more than 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, is a discerning Bostonian’s dream come true. Whether you rely on a vehicle to get around, prefer biking the city or generally rely on public transportation, you will appreciate the ease with which you can get from point A to point B from this centrally located condo development – and how close it is to major sites like Harborwalk, the Seaport, Faneuil Hall and the North End.</p>

                <p>Situated as it is on one end of the storied Rose Kennedy Greenway, the Boulevard offers direct access to that linear park and all that it has to offer. Boasting more than 17 acres along more than one mile in the heart of the city, the Greenway plays host to more than 400 free events every year. Biking and running paths wend their way through gorgeously landscaped gardens, and tinkling fountains are found around nearly every turn. The Greenway seamlessly connects several downtown neighborhoods, providing the perfect way for pedestrians and cyclists to navigate this part of the city.</p>

                <p>Indeed, in terms of recreation, the Boulevard couldn’t be more effectively located. The Greenway alone provides everything that any avid runner or cyclist could want. Boston Common is not too far away, and you can always find plenty to do over there. Downtown Crossing and all of its dining and entertainment are just minutes away too, but you don’t have to venture far to find what you need when you live at the Boulevard. The ground floor of the building is reserved for more than 3,500 square feet of retail space that is certain to be taken over by boutique shops and eateries.</p>

                <p>Another perk regarding the location of this building is the fact that it is close to many major public transit sites. If you rely on the MBTA in any capacity, as most Bostonians do, you will appreciate the short walk that it takes to reach one. The building is also within close proximity of MBTA ferries that can help you to get around the city and surrounding areas with ease. In fact, if you decide on a whim to visit Cape Cod, a ferry to take you there should only be a few minutes away.</p>

                <p>Boulevard on the Greenway is also just minutes away from Boston’s exciting and emerging Seaport District, which is home to some of the most sought-after new luxury residences and entertainment spots in the city. With a condo at the Boulevard, you can make the most of everything that the Seaport has to offer without having to actually live there. You also enjoy easy access to the North End, which is one of the loveliest and most walkable neighborhoods in the city. Additionally, Faneuil Hall and all of the shopping and dining that surrounds are just a short trip away.</p>

                <p>Because of its incredible location along one of the loveliest linear parks in the country, Boulevard on the Greenway didn’t have to do too much marketing to attract tenants and buyers. In fact, more than 75 percent of the building was sold out well before it opened. Today, a few units remain, so you still have a chance to secure a home in one of the best locations in the city. You can start by signing up for access to Boston City Properties’ listings, where you can check current availability.
