            <h1>First Automated Garage Parking System in New England Opens at Boulevard on the Greenway</h1>

            <div>

                <p>Considering the luxuriousness and expense of the sprawling new condos at Boulevard on the Greenway, the new luxury condo building that includes portions of an old warehouse that was designed by renowned Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, it should come as no surprise that the developers wanted to offer the best of the best to residents. When you add in the fact that space is truly at a premium on the waterfront downtown, it’s even less surprising that traditional parking solutions were off the table. Instead, the building boasts a first for any major city in New England: a fully automated garage parking system that involves no human interaction at all.</p>

                <p>Already popular in many parts of Asia and Europe as well as in some U.S. cities, the robotic car parking system, which is also known as a robotic valet system or “car vault,” automatically takes residents’ cars and maneuvers them to specific, assigned spaces in the four-story below-ground parking garage. Unlike traditional parking garages, however, this one includes no staircases or ramps. As a result, it is able to accommodate far more parking spaces in much more compact environs.</p>

                <p>The building offers 36 luxury condo units. Many of them include a parking space in the high-tech underground garage, which boasts 48 spaces. Akin to valet parking minus the valet, the system allows residents to pull up when they arrive at the building and to commence the parking system either via a mobile phone app or via a computerized system on a nearby kiosk. Once they have been swiped into the system, the automated system takes care of the rest. The same process essentially happens in reverse when retrieving a car; either through the app or kiosk, residents summon their vehicles, which are then delivered to them within a few minutes.</p>

                <p>The technology behind the automated parking system at Boulevard on the Greenway is impressive indeed. Installed by PARKPLUS, the high-density storage garage, as it is also billed, features four levels of secure vehicle parking. After driving into an entrance at the back of the building, a resident leaves their vehicle on top of a metal tray in the specific area. The tray then slides into a massive elevator, taking the car along with it. The elevator then brings the vehicle to the appropriate level in the garage – which is wherever the assigned parking space happens to be.</p>

                <p>After delivering the vehicle to the correct level of the garage, a device slides under the tray with the car on it and maneuvers it into its assigned space. Before doing so, however, it turns the car around so that it will be ready to go when the owner comes back to retrieve it. The device then picks up a new tray and maneuvers back to the elevator, where it returns to the ground floor and awaits its next vehicle. All told, the process takes just a few short minutes.</p>

                <p>Although the automated garage parking system at the Boulevard is the first of its kind in New England, it won’t remain the only one for very long. In fact, one is being developed for the under-construction 40 Rugg Road apartment development in Allston that will accommodate more than 150 vehicles. Needless to say, automated garage parking is sure to pick up momentum with its convenience and space-saving features.
