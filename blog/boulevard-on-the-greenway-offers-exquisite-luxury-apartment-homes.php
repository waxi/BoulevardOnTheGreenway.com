                <p>Although best-known for offering high-end condo residences, the new Boulevard on the Greenway development at 110 Broad Street on the waterfront downtown also has apartments for rent from time to time. If you are in the market for a luxury apartment that offers some of the most stunning views of the Greenway and surroundings, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better option. With only 36 units total in the entire building, however, competition for these apartments is fierce. If you would like to rent one, Boston City Properties can help. In the meantime, learn more about what you’ll enjoy as a resident of this incredible building.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, there are 36 luxury residences across the 12 stories of the new Boulevard on the Greenway. The majority of them – 22 in total – are one-bedroom, one-bathroom units that offer an average of 764 square feet of space. Numerous floor plans are available, however, and many of these units include extra office space that can be used as a second bedroom. As with all of the residences in this building, one-bedroom units feature open floor plans that allow you to make the most of the space.</p>

                <p>The building also includes 11 two-bedroom, two-bath units that offer an average of 1,082 square feet of space. Its top two floors are dominated by its three especially elegant penthouse units, which feature duplex designs and two stories. Not surprisingly, the penthouse units were snapped up fairly quickly. However, it would not be surprising to see one hit the market as a rental at some point. These state-of-the-art condo units offer private rooftop decks, making them especially alluring for those who want to enjoy the best views of the Greenway, Harbor and surrounding areas.</p>

                <p>If you are a working artist, you might also consider one of the building’s five special artist’s residences. These are designed more as lofts, and they don’t offer quite as much space as some of the other layouts. They are also reserved solely for actual working artists, so you must be able to prove this credential to be considered for such a residence. It is unclear whether these units have all been sold yet or not or whether they are available for rent at this time. If you believe that you have the credentials, however, you might consider looking into them when renting an apartment in this area.</p>

                <p>Kitchens in all of the residences in this building are simply incredible. They feature huge islands that provide plenty of extra counter space for preparing meals. White quartzite countertops lend these kitchens a clean, crisp and thoroughly modern look that you are sure to love. Custom cabinetry and chic hardwood floors add to the upscale style of these kitchens, which also include high-end appliances by brands like Sub-Zero, Wolf and Thermidor. Wall ovens make it easier to prepare meals and to keep the space as neat and clean as can be.</p>

                <p>Additional perks to be found in the apartments at Boulevard on the Greenway include:</p>

                    <li>Balconies are included in many units, and they are recessed to provide exceptional privacy</li>
                
                    <li>All units include at least one fireplace. Some are dual-sided, and some can be found in master bedrooms</li>
                
                    <li>Walk-in closets, huge pantries and other storage areas make it easy to keep everything organized</li>
