                <p>Courtney Wood of Boston City Properties represented the buyer for one of Boston's most spectacular condos:  PH3 at Boulevard on the Greenway.   Much has been made about the opening of Boulevard on the Greenway, the new luxury condo building that is located at 110 Broad Street. Featuring only 36 condo residences, the building managed to sell or lease most of them within a very short period of time. In a city where condo sales rarely make headlines, however, the sale of Penthouse 3 in the building managed to make a splash. When it sold in February 2019, it did so for the jaw-dropping price of $5,835,000. Considering what you get for that price, though, you could argue that it’s something of a steal. </p> 

                <p>Indeed, in the highly competitive luxury condo market that has been dominating downtown Boston for some time now, it isn’t easy to find a sale that truly makes a mark. The sale of Penthouse 3, however, shows that there are still plenty of people out there who are more than willing to fork over big bucks for the distinction of living above most of the rest of us. With two stories incorporating 3,840 square feet of space, the condo in question is indeed a rarity even in a fast-paced residential real estate market like Boston’s.</p>

                <p>One of just three penthouses available at the Boulevard, Penthouse 3 includes not just two levels but two deeded parking spaces. That may not seem like such a big deal at first, but the parking situation at the Boulevard is anything but ho-hum. To make the most of the extremely limited space available to them, developers opted to install a fully automated parking system below the building – the first of its kind in New England. Whoever purchased Penthouse 3 in this building also purchased two deeded parking spaces in the four-level car storage area, as it is known – and they will never have to venture down below to fetch their vehicles themselves.</p>

                <p>Penthouse 3 is worth its high price tag for lots of reasons. It has the potential for up to three bedrooms, with one extra room available for use as an office, den or spare bedroom. It boasts 3.5 bathrooms, and each of them feature exquisite finishes and fixtures along with gleaming marble vanities and floors. Like other condos in the building, the penthouse features at least one gas fireplace, which is perfect for chilly Boston evenings. Its gourmet kitchen offers shimmering white quartzite countertops, appliances by Wolf, Sub-Zero and Thermidor, a vast entertainment-sized island and many other high-end touches.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most exciting thing of all about Penthouse 3 at the Boulevard is the fact that it includes its very own private rooftop deck. While semi-private balconies are available in other units and fairly ubiquitous among residential towers in the city, very few private residences offer truly private rooftop accommodations. The owners of this luxurious penthouse will be able to step out onto the roof whenever they would like to privately take in stunning views of the Rose Kennedy Greenway, the Boston Harbor and other surrounding areas.</p>

                <p>So, is Penthouse 3 at the Boulevard on the Greenway truly worth its sale price? Most real estate experts likely agree that it is actually somewhat of a steal given its location. There’s also the fact that the building is both modern and historic, thanks to the incorporation of the Charles Bulfinch-designed warehouse from the 19th century into its design. Naturally, the building’s prime location makes it a great choice for people who need close access to downtown and surrounding areas.
