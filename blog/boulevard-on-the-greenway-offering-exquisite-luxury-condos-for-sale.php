                <p>If you would like to own a condo in a building that provides the perfect fusion of old and new, look no further than the luxury condos at Boulevard on the Greenway. Located at 110 Broad Street on the waterfront downtown, the building features new, modern architecture along with elements of a 19th-century warehouse that was designed by renowned architect Charles Bulfinch. The architects behind the spacious condos in this building have gone out of their way to provide big-city luxury living at its best. Read on to learn more about these exciting residences and how Boston City Properties can help you to acquire one.</p>

                <p>Standing 12 stories tall, Boulevard on the Greenway was originally going to be an apartment building with more than 50 units. Plans changed, however, and the building now offers 36 luxury condos with spacious, open floor plans and lots of exciting features. It should be noted here that 31 of these are market-rate units while five of them are reserved as artist’s residences, where local artists can combine living and working space in a modern and open environment.</p>

                <p>Although more than 75 percent of the units in this building had sold out nearly a year before its official opening, several luxury condos are still available – including one of the building’s coveted two-story penthouse units. Before delving into the details of the different options that are currently available, let’s consider the features that are shared among most of these condos. For example, all of them include wide-open floor plans that are enhanced by floor-to-ceiling windows that afford incredible views of the Greenway, Boston Harbor and surrounding areas. They all feature high-end gourmet kitchens with white quartzite countertops, entertainment-sized islands and first-rate appliances from brands like Thermidor, Sub-Zero and Wolf.</p>

                <p>All of the condos in this building include at least one gas-powered fireplace. In smaller units, it is found in the living area, which segues seamlessly into the dining area. In others, you will also find a gas fireplace in the master bedroom. Many units boast dual-sided fireplaces that add warmth and coziness to several living spaces at once. All of the luxury condos here feature in-unit washers and dryers, and many of them boast balconies that are recessed into the building. This feature allows you to enjoy amazing views while still getting enough privacy.</p>

                <p>Given the spaciousness and luxuriousness of the condos at Boulevard on the Greenway, it comes as no surprise that they command very high price tags. One of the smaller units that is currently available, a one-plus-bedroom, two-bathroom unit offering 1,365 square feet of space, is currently listed for $1.94 million. The living room in this unit includes a gas fireplace and a dining area, and there is an outdoor balcony directly off of the living room. The small den can double as a second bedroom or office.</p>

                <p>On the other end of the scale, the largest condo that is currently available in this building is one of the two-story penthouses. This one offers three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms; each bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom, which is a nice perk. Offering 4,054 square feet of space across an open floor plan, this condo is currently listed for sale at $6.95 million. Its private rooftop deck provides amazing views of the city and is among its most unique features.</p>
