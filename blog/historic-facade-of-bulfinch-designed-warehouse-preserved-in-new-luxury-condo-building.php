            <h1>Historic Façade of Bulfinch-Designed Warehouse Preserved in New Luxury Condo Building</h1>

            <div>

                <p>In a deft display of retaining historical architecture while integrating it into fully modern building design, The Boulevard on the Greenway, a new 12-story luxury condo building that is located at 110 Broad Street on the waterfront downtown, now plays a crucial role in memorializing one of the greatest architects in American history. Located at one end of the lovely Rose Kennedy Greenway, the luxury building was constructed on the site of a warehouse that once stored goods coming in from the wharves – and that warehouse was designed by Charles Bulfinch, regarded by many as the first American-born American architect.</p>

                <p>When plans began for the development of the residential tower on Broad Street, developers noted that the old warehouse on the site was one of very few remaining structures that had been designed by Bulfinch on that thoroughfare. While the new building was primarily designed with sleek, modern aesthetics in mind, the warehouse’s designation as a city landmark prompted developers and architects to incorporate parts of it into the design of the condo tower. Due to the design of the new building, which includes a four-story underground automated parking system, it was decided that only the façade of the Bulfinch warehouse would be preserved.</p>

                <p>Those who have an understanding of the history of American architecture are undoubtedly familiar with the work of Charles Bulfinch. Born in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1763, Bulfinch attended the Boston Latin School and Harvard University. He completed his first building, Hollis Street Church, in 1788. The following year, he built the first monument to the American Revolution – a memorial column on Beacon Hill. However, Bulfinch is probably best known for his work designing the Boston Common; the remodeling and expansion of Faneuil Hall; the construction of India Wharf; and the design and construction of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.</p>

                <p>Constructed in 1805, back when Boston Harbor still reached all the way up behind Broad Street, the warehouse featured a Federalist style of architecture that is rarely seen in the city of Boston. Due to its prime location directly on the harbor, the warehouse served as a storage place for goods that arrived at the nearby wharves. Over the course of more than 150 years, landfills pushed back the boundaries of the harbor, so Broad Street is no longer on the water.</p>

                <p>In 1983, the Boston Landmarks Commission cited the Bulfinch warehouse on Broad Street as a “fine example of commercial architecture in Federal Style, which is rare in downtown Boston.” Although the warehouse’s historical significance was well understood, the building itself failed to find a renewed purpose for some time after the nature of commerce along the waterfront evolved. Most recently, its interior served as the location of The Littlest Bar, but that establishment has been closed for some time now.</p>

                <p>Rather than completely raze the building, which would have forever done away with such a unique example of Bulfinch’s work and vision, developers of Boulevard on the Greenway chose to incorporate the warehouse’s façade into the design of its contemporary lobby. The work of retaining the façade was delicate and painstaking; at certain points, workers wielding sledgehammers had to finetune the results. Close attention was paid to the variegated gray brick panels and inset balconies, which complement the copper cladding that is featured on the Greenway.</p>

                <p>A sloped glass prow, in a nod to the city’s maritime history, now rises from the trapezoidal building, which boasts 31 luxury condos; five live-in artist’s lofts; 3,500 square feet of retail space; and 48 underground parking spaces featuring a four-level automated garage parking system.
